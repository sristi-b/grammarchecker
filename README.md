# grammarchecker
This is my submission for the grammar checker. This is using Graformer. I have not yet implemented it using deep learning and NLP yet as I am new to NLP 
and feature extraction in NLP. To be able to make this a full up and running model which trains and tests data, I need to apply Natural Language processing
to preprocess the data. The first part corrects the sentences, 
the second part shows where the error is. This is the most I can do for now.
Here is the output :
